# Digital Wallet system
📌 Overview
The Digital Wallet System is a secure, scalable, and efficient platform for managing digital transactions, storing funds, and facilitating seamless payments. Built using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, the system supports real-time balance tracking, transaction history, and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure security and compliance.

🚀 Key Features
✅ User Management – Secure authentication & role-based access (Admin, User).
✅ Fund Transactions – Deposit, withdrawal, and transfer with real-time balance updates.
✅ Transaction History – Full ledger with timestamps and verification.
✅ Security & Authentication – Uses JWT-based authentication & password encryption.
✅ Caching for Performance – Utilizes Redis to optimize transaction processing.
✅ Event-Driven Architecture – Kafka integration for scalable transaction handling.
✅ RESTful API – Exposes endpoints for external integrations and mobile applications.

🔒 Security Measures
🔹 JWT-Based Authentication – Secure access tokens for API requests.
🔹 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Prevents unauthorized actions.
🔹 Data Encryption – Passwords stored using BCrypt hashing.
🔹 API Rate Limiting – Prevents abuse and fraud.
